# Hi, I'm WinTone01 👋

## Systems-Oriented Software Engineer

I don't just write code — I build systems. For me, a project isn't just a collection of files; it's an engineering challenge built on the balance of **performance**, **security**, **scalability**, and **sustainability**.

### 🎯 Core Philosophy

```
Performance First  → Systems must be fast, stable, and optimized
Secure by Design   → Security is fundamental, not an afterthought  
Architecture Over Hacks → Long-term, scalable solutions over quick fixes
```

## 🔧 What I Build

While my journey started with **game infrastructure** and **Minecraft server development**, I've evolved into building broader systems:

- 🏗️ **Backend Architecture** — Scalable service design and API development
- 🔐 **Security Systems** — Anti-cheat logic, access control, and system isolation
- 🚀 **High-Performance Infrastructure** — Optimization, concurrency, and resource management
- 🏪 **Marketplace Platforms** — Full-stack marketplace and control panel backends
- 🤖 **Automation Systems** — CI/CD pipelines, deployment automation, and DevOps tools
- 🐳 **Containerized Deployment** — Docker-based infrastructure

I'm not just a plugin developer — I'm a **game infrastructure engineer** who thinks at the architecture level.

## 🚀 Current Focus

🔨 Working on **Speaway** project  
📚 Deepening expertise in **Java** and **Python**  
🎯 Exploring **microservices architecture** and **AI-powered automation**  
🌱 Learning **enterprise-level infrastructure scaling**

## 💡 Engineering Approach

What sets me apart isn't just coding skills — it's **system thinking**:

- ✅ I don't just make features work; I ask **"How can it work best?"**
- ✅ I design for the **entire system**, not just individual components
- ✅ I solve problems from the **root**, not the surface
- ✅ I build **maintainable architectures**, not temporary patches

For a marketplace project, I don't just integrate payments — I architect the entire flow: user experience, support system, admin panel, data structure, scaling scenarios, and deployment strategy.
